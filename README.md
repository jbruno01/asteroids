##Summary
----
* A browser game similar to the classic arcade game. Written in Javascript using HTML5 canvas.
* Gameplay includes points, levels with increasing number of asteroids, and a finite number of "lives".
* Position and movement of all objects determined through vector geometry. Custom collision detection function.

## Features
* Large asteroids split in to smaller asteroids when hit. Dynamic scoring system awards more points for smaller asteroids. Score is constantly tracked and updated.
* Levels increase in difficulty by incrementing the number of asteroids.
* Background is dynamic field of "stars" of varying size and velocity, giving the illusion of depth.

* Have asteroids accurately collide and recoil
* Switch ship movement to a "rotate and thrust" model
* Add graphics through sprites
